## Introduction

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to extract meaningful insights about the survival rates of passengers based on various factors such as age, sex, class, etc. The project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and conclusion reporting.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle. You can download the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-data-analysis.git
   cd titanic-data-analysis
   
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```


3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Usage
1. Download the Titanic dataset from Kaggle and place it in the data/ directory.

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to perform the analysis:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/titanic_analysis.ipynb
   ```
3. Generate plots and save them to the images/ directory:
   ```python
   # In the Jupyter Notebook, run the cells to generate plots
   ```
## Analysis

## Data Cleaning

Filled missing values in the 'Age' column with the median age.

Filled missing values in the 'Embarked' column with the mode.

Dropped the 'Cabin' column due to a high number of missing values.

Converted categorical variables 'Sex' and 'Embarked' to numeric values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed survival rates by sex, class, and age group.

Generated descriptive statistics for the dataset.

## Data Visualization

Plotted survival rates by sex.

Plotted survival rates by class.

Plotted survival rates by age group.

## Conclusions

Females had a higher survival rate compared to males.

Passengers in the first class had a higher survival rate compared to those in the second and third classes.

Children and young adults had higher survival rates compared to other age groups.
